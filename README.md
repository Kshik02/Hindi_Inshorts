# Hindi_Inshorts
This is the project done by my team for our Natural Language Processing course during my undergraduation. The python code takes a Hindi text as input, and creates inshorts, i.e. summarizes it.

## How to use
   1. Paste the Hindi UTF-8 text, which is to be summarised, in the [**InputText**](https://github.com/Kshik02/Hindi_Inshorts/blob/master/InputText) file.
   2. Run the [**HindiInshorts.py**](https://github.com/Kshik02/Hindi_Inshorts/blob/master/HindiInshorts.py) file.
   3. Check the output in the [**SummarizedText**](https://github.com/Kshik02/Hindi_Inshorts/blob/master/SummarizedText) file.
